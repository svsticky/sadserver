# When defining a secret, define the value as a Jinja2 reference to the same
# variable name, but prefixed with "vault_", and define that key in vault.yml.
# In that way there is an overview of what secrets are used, without everyone
# having to have access to the values.

# This is also used for the root user, but the "$" at the end is replaced by a
# "#" through a regex in tasks/users.yml.
