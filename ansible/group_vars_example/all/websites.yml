# When defining a secret, define the value as a Jinja2 reference to the same
# variable name, but prefixed with "_vault", and define that key in vault.yml.
# In that way there is an overview of what secrets are used, without everyone
# having to have access to the values.

# Defines our websites. Important to note is that the "name" of a website should
# always be a subdomain of the canonical hostname (using the
# "canonical_hostname" variable). This has to do with the current state of our
# DNS zones, and ensures that TLS certificates are set up correctly in the
# staging environment. This could be improved perhaps.
