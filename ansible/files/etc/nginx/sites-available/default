##
## nginx default vhost
##
## The purpose of this host is to act as a catch-all for verification
## requests from Let's Encrypt. It is the only vhost that listens on HTTP
## on this server, as all other hosts just listen on HTTPS.
##
## It serves requests for the URI '/.well-known/acme-challenge', from the
## /var/www/acme_challenges directory. All other hosts/URIs are redirected
## to the HTTPS version of the URI.
