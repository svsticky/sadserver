# Contributing
So you're thinking about contributing to our server workspace, great!
To make sure every contributor is on the same 'page', the CommIT team advises to keep the following guidelines in mind when contributing.

## Branching Strategy
For branching, we apply the same branching strategy as we use in Koala:
- `feature/` for new features.
- `bug/` for bugfixes.
- `doc/` for documentation.
- `test/` for testing.
- `debt/` for refactoring and enhancements.

## Commit Messages
Please make sure to write descriptive commit messages:
1. The header should be 72 characters or less.
2. Write messages in the imperative: "Fix bug X", "Add feature Y", etc.
3. Reference issue in commit that fixes it: "Fixes #12: Remove bug Z".
4. Add a body to the message in which you elaborate on the header.

## Thanks!
Thank you a lot for any PR's!
