# This is an Ansible inventory file in INI format. You can define a list of
# hosts and groups to be managed by this particular inventory.

# Hosts listed under [ansible_controllers] will have common DebOps plays
# ran against them. It will include services such as iptables, DNS, Postfix,
# sshd configuration and more.
#
# View the list here:
# https://github.com/debops/debops-playbooks/blob/master/playbooks/common.yml

# Your host is not Debian-based so you will not be able to leverage
# the above features on your current operating system. You can however
# use Vagrant or something else to setup a VM and install DebOps there.
